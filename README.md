# TodoList

TodoList is a webpage I created to track tasks. Tasks can be added, updated, and deleted through a user interface and the tasks are displayed on the page. The tasks are stored in a database and the information can be accessed through a REST API. 

Database: SQLAlchemy and SQlite.
Framework: Flask
API: Flask RESTful
